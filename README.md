# Freesend - Your Email API Using Your Infrastructure!

## Overview

**Freesend** is a lightweight email API built for developers who want full control over email delivery without the complexity or cost of third-party platforms.

Hosted at **[freesend.metafog.io](https://freesend.metafog.io)**, it lets you send emails through a simple HTTP API using **your own SMTP provider** (like Gmail, Zoho, Mailgun, etc.).

Designed with **serverless apps, indie hackers, and backend engineers** in mind, Freesend lets you send emails through a simple HTTP API ‚Äî powered entirely by **your own SMTP server** (like Gmail, Zoho, Mailgun, etc.).

No vendor lock-in. No usage caps. No surprise pricing.

## Why Freesend?

Most email platforms either:

- Limit you to **a few hundred free emails per month**
- Charge a premium for usage-based pricing
- Lock you into **their** infrastructure

Freesend flips that model:

‚úÖ **Use Your Own SMTP**  
‚úÖ **Simple HTTP API**  
‚úÖ **Free & Open Source (and you don't need to self-host!)**  

Ideal for:

- Serverless apps that need reliable transactional emails
- Startups who want full transparency & control
- Developers who value simplicity and clean open-source code
